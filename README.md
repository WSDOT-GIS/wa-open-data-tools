ðŸš§ Work in progress ðŸš§

## Getting started

<!-- Once we've published the module to PowerShell Gallery a/o Github Packages, add installation instructions. -->

Begin by importing the module

```pwsh
Import-Module .\wa-open-data.psd1
```

## Getting help for the module's commands

Once you've imported the module, you can display a list of commands

```pwsh
Get-Command -Module wa-open-data
```

Get help for any command with the [Get-Help] command. Replace `Do-Something` with the actual name of the command.

```pwsh
Get-Help Do-Something
```

## Still to do

* [ ] Publish package to repository for easier user experience.

    User currently has to manually download the files and then run them from the current location or use their profile script to utilize them.
